About Me
I embarked on my coding journey back in 12th grade when I got introduced to C++. Since then, I've been fascinated by the world of programming. In my first year of college, I delved into Python, which opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. In my second year, I started exploring web development, and that's when I discovered the MERN stack, which has become my forte.
